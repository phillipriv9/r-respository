## There are 3 componetns to a Quarto doucment

1. The YML header:
    * Another markup language: essentially allows you to alter the aspects of the document
    * defines TOC, etc
  
2. Prose aka text
    * we can make text **bold**
    * we can make text *italic*
    * and a variety of other aspects
    
3. Code Chunks: this where we code.

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
#| echo: false
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
